This dataset is an extract from the public [Stack Overflow dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/stack-exchange/stack-overflow) for use as a tutorial on tensorflow.org. It contains the body of 80,000 posts on four languages (Java, Python, CSharp, and Javascript), which have been equally divided into train and test.
Additionally, the keywords java, python, CSharp and Javascript have been replaced in each post by the word `blank`, in order to make it more difficult to handle by Natural Language Processing algorithms.
