    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is the [Auto MPG dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) from Kaggle. The version of the dataset you will use in this tutorial is built into Tensorflow. The trained model predicts the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to create a custom model from a Python script in a custom docker container using the AI Platform (Unified) SDK, and then do a prediction on the deployed model. You can alternatively create custom models from the command line using `gcloud` or online using Google Cloud Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a custom docker container for training.\n",
    "- Create a AI Platform (Unified) custom job for training a model.\n",
    "- Train the model using the custom container.\n",
    "- Retrieve and load the model (artifacts).\n",
    "- View the model evaluation.\n",
    "- Upload the model as a AI Platform (Unified) model.\n",
    "- Deploy the model to a serving endpoint.\n",
