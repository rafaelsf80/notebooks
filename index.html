This site is under construction. Contains **a list of public notebooks** I use for lectures and presentations, mainly around Deep Learning. 
Expect some typos, and please note some of the notebooks are in Spanish.

This website is powered by [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.

Image below show the complete end-to-end cycle for machine learning development in Google Cloud.
You can use [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks) (paid service), Binder or Colab to run the notebooks on this site.
