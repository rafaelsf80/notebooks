This site is under construction. Contains **a list of notebooks** I use for lectures and presentations, mainly around Deep Learning. 
Expect some typos, and please note some of them contains text cells in Spanish.

Image below show the complete end-to-end cycle for machine learning development in Google Cloud.
You can use AI Platform Notebooks (paid service), Binder or Colab to run the notebooks on this page.
